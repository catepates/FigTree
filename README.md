## Next steps

### Before launch (aim: before the Lower Hutt Art Trail, 17–18 October)

- [x] Netlify → Environment variables: `SHEET_ID` set for all contexts, Production included (checked 12 Oct).
- [x] Netlify visitor access (13 Oct): preview links need the shared password (non-production only); catepates.co.nz is public but shows only the coming-soon page until launch.
- [x] Netlify → Forms → Form notifications: email to Cate (catepatesnz@gmail.com) and Dom.
- [ ] Cate's look at the preview site: with the shared preview password (the team invite didn't work for her). Launch waits for her approval.
- [x] Launched 15 Oct 2026 ("Cate Approves Website Launch"): coming-soon and noindex settings removed, `main` published.
- [x] Daily website check secrets (`ALERT_EMAIL_USER` / `ALERT_EMAIL_PASSWORD`) added in GitHub.
- [ ] After launch run *Check the website* once with *Pretend it failed* (and once without) to test the emails.

### After launch

- [ ] **Next update (one deploy, about 15 credits), saved up by Dom:** (24 Oct: everything but the logo went live)
    - [ ] Switch to Dom's preferred logo (`docs/logo-draft/fig-tree-mark-preferred.svg`, see *New logo* below), then regenerate the browser/Google icons (`site/favicon.ico`, `site/img/icon*.png|svg`, `apple-touch-icon.png`) and the print files from it.
    - [x] Count *Book now* clicks per workshop in GoatCounter (done 24 Oct 2026).
    - [x] Daily check: re-check after a minute before emailing about a failure (done 24 Oct 2026).
    - [x] Add `?c=website` to Humanitix booking links automatically (done 24 Oct 2026).
- [ ] **Gallery sources as plug-ins.** Today ORA and The Vault are handled by name in several places (build scripts, `/api/vault`, `site/js/ora.js`, the Gallery page sections, `where-to-buy.js`, the status page, the daily check). Restructure so each gallery is one file in a `galleries/` folder that only fetches its pieces (title, price, size, photo, link), picked by a **Source** column in the Galleries tab; the build, hourly live check, Gallery page sections, homepage counts, status page and daily check all loop over the sources. Adding a gallery then = one file + one Sheet value. Test against the current ORA and Vault listings so nothing changes for visitors.
- [ ] "How Cate works" process page (`site/process.html`, drafted and hidden): add Thursday's studio photos and Cate's answers, then add it to the menu.
- [ ] Cate's own Stripe account (public name "Cate Pates") before selling studio pieces or prints; decide on posting and update the delivery terms.
- [ ] Prints: print and post herself, or print-on-demand.
- [ ] **New logo (Cate, after her first workshop).** Cate wants to refine the fig tree mark. It's `site/img/fig-tree-mark.svg`, used in the site header, as the browser-tab icon and on `coming-soon/`; the social-share image `site/img/og-image.jpg` doesn't include it. A photo or scan of her drawing is enough to redraw it as SVG. **Dom's preferred version (17 Oct 2026, not live yet):** `docs/logo-draft/fig-tree-mark-preferred.svg`. It is the current tree plus a spur from the trunk between the two lower branches (with a fig), with the bark merged into one smoothed outline, rounded joins and one leaf moved off the trunk. To use it, copy it over `site/img/fig-tree-mark.svg` and regenerate the print files.
- [ ] Domain email (hello@catepates.co.nz) when there's time; steps in the migration guide.
- [ ] **Carry out the migration plan (Cate and Dom), before about 13 November 2026.** Move the GitHub repository, Netlify project, domain and Google files into Cate's accounts, following the migration guide. Netlify: Dom's team was upgraded to **Pro on 13 Oct 2026** (one month, paid by Dom) so Cate could join it as a team member and check the preview before launch; Pro renews monthly until cancelled. Once the project has moved to Cate's own team, put Dom's team back on the free plan (Team settings → Billing).

### Potter's stamp (maker's mark): where to get it made

A small stamp of the fig tree mark (or initials) for pressing into the clay, to sign each piece. Wellington City Libraries' makerspaces can make it:

- **Te Whaitua Auaha, the Central Library makerspace.** Jobs are submitted through its online *Job Submission Form* (survey.alchemer.com, titled "Te Whaitua Auaha Job Submission Form").
- **Tūhura | The HIVE, Johnsonville Library.** Email thehive@wcc.govt.nz instead of using the form.
- **Services:** 3D printing (filament), 3D printing (resin), laser cutting. Resin printing gives the finest detail for a stamp face; laser cutting suits a flat acrylic or wood stamp.
- **Timing:** a quote within two working days; then up to three weeks to complete once the quote is accepted.
- **To prepare:** a clean, single-colour version of the mark (SVG or STL), mirrored so it reads correctly when pressed, sized about 15–25 mm, with a handle.

### To do with Cate

- [ ] **Humanitix refund policy:** every event currently says *Refund Policy: No refunds* (a Humanitix preset that breaches NZ consumer law on its own). For the current and future events: Payments & fees → Refunds → **Custom**, paste the workshop wording from her guide, and turn on **self-service refunds** (100% of ticket price, up to 7 days before). Add a checkout tick box "I've read and agree to the workshop terms".
- [ ] Find any other "no refunds" wording (Instagram/Facebook posts, the Google Form she's contacted through) and replace it with a link to `/terms.html`.
- [ ] Ask people with refund requests to use the website contact form rather than private messages.
- [ ] Cate to check the decisions in the terms: not GST-registered, pieces decorative only, 7-day workshop window, 5-day posting, 50% commission deposit, photos at workshops, under-16s with an adult.
- [ ] Have the terms looked over (business.govt.nz guidance or a local lawyer) before launch.

The site uses the "Gallery" design (clean and white, Cormorant Garamond + Instrument Sans, fig tree mark). Pages live in `site/`:

| Page | File |
|---|---|
| Home | `site/index.html` |
| Gallery — from Cate's studio (Stripe), at ORA and The Vault + selected past work, with a type filter (houses, vessels, creatures, prints) | `site/work.html` |
| Workshops | `site/workshops.html` |
| Media — articles, podcasts, radio, video | `site/media.html` |
| About + contact form | `site/about.html` (form handled by Netlify Forms; thank-you page `site/thanks.html`) |

Shared styles are in `site/css/style.css`. The site is kept out of search engines until launch (`site/robots.txt` and the header in `netlify.toml`) — remove both to go public.

## Project history

- **6 Oct 2026, 2:42pm:** Dom starts building the site with Claude, after sitting down with Cate at the MyHost site builder. Website building had been on Cate's to-do list for months.
- **7 Oct:** first version in GitHub (a holding page with Cate's ORA pieces); Netlify account created; full site built (home, gallery, workshops, about).
- **7–12 Oct:** Google Sheet control (workshops, studio, galleries, exhibitions, media, announcements); live ORA and The Vault listings; terms checked against NZ consumer law with Cate's edits; podcast player; coming-soon page on catepates.co.nz.
- **13 Oct:** daily website health check with email alerts; Netlify Pro so Cate can see the preview; ready to launch on Cate's approval, one week after starting (64 saved versions).
- **28 Oct:** footer centred (© line, then the Instagram and Facebook icons) with room underneath for the "Powered by Netlify" badge that the free Netlify team adds to the bottom-right of every page.

## The Google Sheet

Workshops, studio pieces, galleries, exhibitions and media come from one Google Sheet with tabs **Workshops**, **Studio**, **Galleries**, **Exhibitions** and **Media**. The column layout (with sample rows) is in `sheet-template/fig-tree-studio-website.xlsx`, and explained for Cate in her user guide.

- The sheet must be shared as *Anyone with the link → Viewer*. Set its id (the long part of its address between `/d/` and `/edit`) as the `SHEET_ID` environment variable in Netlify (scope: Functions), then redeploy.
- `netlify/functions/sheet.mjs` serves each tab as JSON at `/api/sheet?tab=<Tab>`; Netlify's CDN caches it for 5 minutes, so edits show within about 5 minutes with no rebuild. Only those five tabs can be read.
- The pages (`site/js/sheet.js` and the page scripts) fall back to `site/data/*.json` and the lists written into the HTML if the sheet isn't set up or can't be reached.
- **Sales** (buyers' names and emails) must never go in this sheet, because it's readable by anyone with the link. Keep it in the separate private sales sheet.

## Workshops

Upcoming workshops come from `site/data/workshops.json` (see `site/js/workshops.js` for the fields). Workshops whose date has passed, or that have `"draft": true`, are hidden; when none are left the page shows "New dates coming soon". The two current entries are drafts until real dates, venues, prices and links are confirmed. This can later read from Cate's Google Sheet instead.

## Media

Articles, podcasts, radio and video features come from `site/data/media.json` (see `site/js/media.js` for the fields: date, type, title, outlet, blurb, link, draft), newest first. The link reads *Listen* for podcasts and radio, *Watch* for video and *Read* otherwise. **The four current entries are placeholders — replace them or mark them `"draft": true` before going live.** This can later read a **Media** tab in the Google Sheet (`date | type | title | outlet | description | link | show`).

## Contact form

Uses Netlify Forms. In Netlify, open Forms → enable form detection, then add an email notification so messages reach Cate.

## How the ORA pieces stay up to date

Nobody needs to edit the site when a piece sells or a price changes.

1. **On every build** (`npm run build`, run by Netlify), `scripts/fetch-ora.mjs` reads Cate's collection from ORA Gallery's shop and, for each piece still for sale:
   - downloads the main photo,
   - **trims the empty background** around the piece and re-frames it at a consistent size, standing near the bottom of a 4:5 frame, so captions sit right under the piece,
   - saves the title, price, size and ORA link to `site/data/ora.json` (photos go in `site/ora/`).

   If ORA can't be reached, the last saved data is kept and the build carries on.
2. **When someone visits**, `site/js/ora.js` draws the pieces and checks ORA once more: pieces sold since the last build disappear, price changes show, and pieces listed since the last build appear straight away with ORA's own photo.
3. **Optional, by hand:** the next build gives new pieces trimmed photos (and refreshes The Vault list). To force one, run the GitHub Action *Refresh ORA photos* (`.github/workflows/refresh-ora.yml`; Actions → Run workflow). It needs a Netlify build hook URL saved as the repository secret `NETLIFY_BUILD_HOOK`. Each run is a production deploy (15 credits).

## Saving Netlify credits

On the free plan each production deploy costs 15 of the 300 monthly credits; branch deploys and previews are free.

- Changes go to `claude/cate-pates-portfolio-l2zfyj` first and show on the free preview link above.
- When happy, merge them into `main` in one go (one pull request = one production deploy).
- Builds are skipped automatically when only files outside the site change (e.g. this README) — see `ignore` in `netlify.toml`.

## Footer and the Netlify badge

On a free Netlify team, Netlify adds a "Powered by Netlify" badge fixed to the bottom-right corner of every page. It used to cover the Instagram and Facebook icons at the right-hand end of the footer, so the footer is now a centred column (the © / Contact / Terms line, then the icons) with 72px of empty space at the bottom where the badge floats (`.site-footer` in `site/css/style.css`, "Social + footer"). The badge itself is left alone. Every page with a footer (home, Gallery, Workshops, Media, About, Terms, process) uses the same footer markup, so footer changes only need making in the stylesheet.

## Coming-soon page (live site until launch)

Until Cate is ready, catepates.co.nz (the production deploy, built from `main`) shows only `coming-soon/index.html`: a one-page holding page in the site's style, linking to ORA, The Vault, Instagram and Facebook. Every address on the live site shows it (`coming-soon/_redirects`). This is set by the `[context.production]` block in `netlify.toml`; branch and preview deploys keep building the full site from `site/`.

**To launch:** delete the `[context.production]` block (and the noindex header block) in `netlify.toml`, then publish `main`.

## Homepage "where to buy" list

`site/js/where-to-buy.js` builds the homepage list from what's actually available: studio pieces and prints (Studio tab, unsold), then every Galleries-tab row with **Has Cate's work now** = yes, linking to its website. ORA and The Vault (matched by name) also get a live piece count (ORA's feed / `/api/vault`, else the built lists) and drop off when it's 0, so a new gallery needs only a Sheet row, no code. Empty sources are left out; with nothing anywhere the list hides and the text points to past work. Nothing on the site promises NZ-wide delivery until Cate decides on posting.

## Announcements

`site/js/announcements.js` (on the home, Gallery, Workshops, About and Media pages) reads the **Announcements** tab and shows each current row as a slim band under the header: Heading, Details, Label, Button text, Link, Start, End, Pages (`All pages` or home page only), Show. Rows outside Start–End (NZ time) are skipped, so an announcement disappears by itself after its End date.

## Media recordings in Google Drive

On the Media page (`site/js/media.js`), an entry whose link is a Google Drive file gets a *Listen* (or *Watch*) button that opens Drive's own player (`/file/d/<id>/preview`) inside the entry, so visitors stay on the site. Other links open as before. The Drive file must be shared *Anyone with the link*.

## Daily website check and email alerts

`scripts/health-checks.mjs` lists everything the site needs and checks it: the main pages load, `/api/sheet` and `/api/vault` answer, the https certificate isn't about to expire, every Sheet tab can be read and still has the column headings the site uses, each upcoming workshop has a readable date and a working Humanitix link, current announcement links, media links (a Drive recording must be shared publicly), studio photos and Stripe payment links, gallery websites and exhibition links, ORA's and The Vault's lists of Cate's pieces, and Stripe's webhook secret once pieces are on sale. Each result is *ok*, *warn* (worth a look) or *fail* (visitors would notice, or bookings or sales would be lost), with a plain-words "What to do".

- `/status.html` (via `/api/status`) shows the results live. Page, function and certificate checks run only on catepates.co.nz, not on Netlify preview addresses (those need a Netlify login).
- `.github/workflows/check-site.yml` runs every morning on GitHub (free, no Netlify credits). It reads `/api/status` on the live site (`.github/scripts/check-site.mjs`). When something fails, it emails **catepatesnz@gmail.com and dom.donald@gmail.com** once, emails again if the problems change, sends a reminder after 7 days, and sends an "all fixed" email when everything passes. Warnings alone never send an email. If anything fails it waits a minute and checks again, and only emails about what failed both times, so a gallery's website having a brief outage doesn't trigger an alert (a check that fails only on the second try shows as a warning). It also keeps a GitHub issue labelled `site-health` open, mentioning @domdonald52, as the record and as a backup alert.
- **Email setup (once):** create a Google app password for the Gmail account that sends the alerts (myaccount.google.com/apppasswords, needs 2-Step Verification). Then add two repository secrets in GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions: `ALERT_EMAIL_USER` (that Gmail address) and `ALERT_EMAIL_PASSWORD` (the app password). Without them only the GitHub issue is created.
- To test: Actions → *Check the website* → Run workflow → tick *Pretend it failed*; run it again unticked for the "all fixed" email. Scheduled checks only run from `main`. GitHub pauses scheduled checks in a public repository after 60 days with no commits and emails a warning first; re-enable it under Actions if that happens.

## Visitor stats

`site/js/stats.js` loads [GoatCounter](https://figtreestudio.goatcounter.com) (account "figtreestudio", Dom's sign-up) on every public page, but only on catepates.co.nz, so preview and local visits aren't counted. No cookies; the privacy section of the terms says what it records. The status page links to the stats. The printed QR codes add `?ref=card` (business cards), `?ref=table` (workshop table card) and `?ref=handout` (take-away cards), which GoatCounter shows under *Referrers*, so you can see how many people scanned each. Clicks on a workshop's booking button are counted as GoatCounter events named `book/<date> <workshop>` (they're listed with the pages), so you can see how many people went on to Humanitix. Humanitix links also get `?c=website` added (`site/js/workshops.js`, unless the Sheet's link already has a `c=` code), so Humanitix's *Reports → Affiliate tracking* shows actual bookings that came from the website; Cate needs to create the code `website` on each event (*Promote → Affiliate tracking*). Without that code the link still works, the booking just isn't counted. Netlify's own *Observability* (raw requests, bots included, 7 days on Pro) is still there for troubleshooting.

## Gallery type filter

`site/js/gallery-filter.js` adds *All · Houses · Vessels · Creatures* buttons to the Gallery page; a *Prints* button appears once any piece is a print. Each card's type comes from `site/js/piece-type.js`: the Studio tab's optional **Type** column first, then words in the title, then ORA's own product tags (e.g. "Vase", "House", "animal"). Pieces that fit none (a tile, wall hearts) show under *All* only. Studio rows typed Print are drawn in their own **Prints** section (`#prints`) after all the ceramics, not under *From Cate's studio*. The choice is kept in the address, e.g. `/work.html?type=vessel`, so it can be linked to.

## Pieces at The Vault

`scripts/fetch-vault.mjs` does the same job for The Vault (2 Plimmer Steps, Wellington) on every build: it reads Cate's artist page on thevaultnz.com and each product page, frames the photos the same way (shared code in `scripts/frame-photo.mjs`) and writes `site/data/vault.json` and `site/vault/`. The Vault's shop has no data feed the browser can read, so the Gallery page also asks `/api/vault` (`netlify/functions/vault.mjs`), which reads the artist page live. Netlify's CDN caches that for an hour for all visitors, so The Vault is read about once an hour: sold pieces drop off and new pieces appear (with The Vault's own photo until the next build). The page parsing lives in `scripts/vault-parse.mjs`, shared by the build and the function; if The Vault changes its layout, fix it there. If the page can't be read, the built list is kept and `/status.html` shows a warning.

## Selling from the studio (Stripe payment links)

Pieces Cate sells herself appear under **From Cate's studio** on the Gallery page. They come from `site/data/studio.json` (later the **Studio** tab of the Google Sheet: `key | title | price | size | photo | link | sold | show`). The two current entries are **placeholders** — remove them before going live. See `site/js/studio.js` for the fields.

How a sale works:

1. Each piece has its own Stripe **payment link** (pasted into `link`). The Buy button adds `client_reference_id=<key>` to it, so Stripe knows which piece it was.
2. The buyer pays on Stripe's checkout page and is sent to `/order-thanks.html`.
3. Stripe calls `/api/stripe-webhook` (`netlify/functions/stripe-webhook.mjs`). The function checks Stripe's signature and, once the payment has gone through, records the piece as sold (Netlify Blobs).
4. The Gallery page asks `/api/studio-sold` and shows the piece as **Sold** straight away — no rebuild, no deploy credits. Cate can also type `yes` in the `sold` column.

A piece with no link shows **Enquire →** (to the contact form) instead of Buy.

### Setting up each payment link (Stripe Dashboard → Payment links → New)

- Product: the piece's name, photo and NZD price, one-off.
- Quantity: fixed at 1. **Limit the number of payments: 1** (so it can never sell twice).
- Collect customers' addresses: shipping, New Zealand only; add shipping rates (e.g. "Courier, insured" and "Pick-up — arranged by email").
- After payment: *Don't show confirmation page* → redirect to `https://<site>/order-thanks.html`.
- Leave payment methods on automatic (Stripe shows cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay etc.).
- Tick **Require customers to accept your terms of service** (needs the terms URL `https://<site>/terms.html` set once under Stripe Settings → Business → Public details).
- Leave automatic tax **off** unless Cate is GST-registered.
- Keep the piece's `key` in the sheet the same once it's listed.

### Connecting the webhook (once per Stripe account, and again for live mode)

1. Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → **Add endpoint**: `https://<site>/api/stripe-webhook`, events `checkout.session.completed` and `checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded`.
2. Copy the endpoint's **signing secret** (`whsec_…`).
3. Netlify → Project configuration → Environment variables → add `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` with that value (scope: Functions; mark it secret). Redeploy.

No Stripe API key is used anywhere. Never paste keys into the code, the sheet or a chat. Test first in a Stripe **sandbox** with test cards (e.g. 4242 4242 4242 4242), then repeat the webhook step in live mode.

## Terms & privacy

`site/terms.html` sets out the terms for buying from the site, commissions and workshops, plus a privacy statement, written to fit NZ consumer law (no blanket "no refunds": change-of-mind refunds can be refused, but faulty/damaged/not-as-described goods are covered by the Consumer Guarantees Act). It's linked from every footer, the studio section, the workshop FAQ and the contact form. Buyers accept it at Stripe checkout (terms checkbox) and in Humanitix (custom refund policy + a terms checkbox question). Not legal advice; have it checked before launch.

## Handing everything over to Cate

Everything is currently in Dom's accounts. A shared studio email on her domain (e.g. hello@catepates.co.nz, forwarding to both) makes the move easiest — use it for all the new accounts.

- [ ] **Stripe** — can't be transferred to another person (it's tied to the owner's identity and bank account). Cate creates her own account, verifies it and adds her bank account, then invites Dom as a team member. Recreate the products and payment links there, paste the new links into the sheet, and repeat *Connecting the webhook* with the new signing secret.
- [ ] **GitHub** — Settings → Danger zone → *Transfer ownership* to Cate's account. She adds Dom back as a collaborator and installs the Claude GitHub app on the repository so Claude sessions can keep working on it.
- [ ] **Netlify** — either *Transfer project* to a team Cate owns (needs you both on that team), or create a new project in her account from the repository (10 minutes). Then: add `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, set the production branch to `main` and branch deploys as now, move the custom domain, export old form submissions, turn on form notifications, and update the Stripe webhook URL if the site address changed.
- [ ] **Google Sheet** — Share → make Cate the owner; Dom stays an editor.
- [ ] **Domain** — check catepates.co.nz is registered in Cate's name at MyHost.
- [ ] **Instagram / Facebook / ORA / The Vault** — nothing to move; the site only links to them.

## Netlify setup

- Import this repository in Netlify ("Add new site → Import an existing project → GitHub").
- Build command and publish folder come from `netlify.toml` (`npm run build`, `site`).
- Production branch: `main`. Branch deploys: `claude/cate-pates-portfolio-l2zfyj` only.
- Optional: create a build hook for `main` (Project configuration → Build & deploy → Build hooks) and save its URL in GitHub as the `NETLIFY_BUILD_HOOK` secret for the manual ORA photo refresh.

Please check with ORA Gallery that they're happy for their listings and photos to appear here.
